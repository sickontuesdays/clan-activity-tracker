2. Create a new application with these settings:
   - **Application Name**: "Sick on Tuesdays Clan Tracker"
   - **Website**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app`
   - **Application Status**: Public
   - **OAuth Client Type**: Not Applicable (we don't use OAuth)
3. Save and copy the **API Key** for BUNGIE_API_KEY

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Fork/clone this repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Add environment variable in Vercel project settings:
   ```
   BUNGIE_API_KEY=your_bungie_api_key_here
   ```
4. Deploy

## How It Works

### Data Collection System

**Public Data Only:**
- Scans all clan members' public profiles using Bungie API
- Collects activity history from last 24 hours
- Shows comprehensive statistics for public profiles
- Automatically skips private profiles (respects privacy settings)
- Focuses on meaningful endgame activities only

### Caching System

**Smart Caching Logic:**
- Activities are cached in browser localStorage
- Cache is automatically updated with newer activities
- Old activities (>24h) are removed from cache
- Significantly reduces API calls and improves performance
- Data persists between browser sessions

### Activity Filtering

**Quality Control:**
- Automatically filters out strikes, patrols, and story missions
- Focuses on raids, dungeons, PvP, trials, nightfalls, and special events
- Provides more meaningful activity tracking for clan performance

### Technical Architecture

**Simplified API System:**
- Single `/api/bungie` endpoint for all Bungie API calls
- No authentication required - uses public API access only
- Efficient batch processing for activity definitions
- Smart rate limiting to avoid API restrictions

## API Endpoints Used

- `/GroupV2/Name/{clanName}/{groupType}/` - Find clan by name
- `/GroupV2/{groupId}/Members/` - Get clan members
- `/Destiny2/{membershipType}/Profile/{membershipId}/` - Get player profiles
- `/Destiny2/{membershipType}/Account/{membershipId}/Character/{characterId}/Stats/Activities/` - Get activity history
- `/Destiny2/Stats/PostGameCarnageReport/{instanceId}/` - Get detailed activity stats
- `/Destiny2/Manifest/DestinyActivityDefinition/{hash}/` - Get activity definitions
- `/Destiny2/Manifest/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/{hash}/` - Get weapon definitions

## Performance Optimizations

- **Local Caching**: Reduces repeated API calls by storing data locally
- **Activity Definition Caching**: Prevents repeated lookups for activity names
- **Weapon Definition Caching**: Stores weapon names to avoid redundant requests
- **Batch Processing**: Fetches multiple definitions in parallel
- **Smart Filtering**: Excludes low-value activities at collection time
- **Pagination**: Loads activities in batches for better performance

## User Interface

### Main Page Layout
- **Header**: Clan name and description
- **Controls**: Load data button and member search dropdown  
- **Left Sidebar**: Time played rankings (most active players)
- **Center**: Activity list with statistics and details
- **Right Sidebar**: Kills rankings (highest performers)

### Activity Details Page
- **Wide Layout**: Accommodates 3-column player display
- **Player Cards**: Green highlighted names with comprehensive stats
- **Contained Sections**: Additional stats scroll within designated areas
- **Team Performance**: Aggregated statistics across all players
- **Weapon Usage**: Individual weapon statistics without damage numbers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to find clan"**
- Verify clan name spelling: "S!ck on Tuesdays!"
- Check if clan is set to public visibility in Destiny 2

**"No recent activities found"**
- Clan members may not have played in the last 24 hours
- Check if clan members' profiles are set to public
- Some members may have private profiles (expected behavior)

**Caching Issues**
- Clear browser localStorage if data seems stale
- Use "Refresh Data" button to force new API calls
- Check browser console for any caching errors

### Data Limitations

**Private Profiles**
- Members with private profiles won't show activity data
- This is by design and respects user privacy choices
- No workaround available - privacy settings are enforced by Bungie

**Activity Types**
- Only shows meaningful endgame activities
- Excludes routine activities like strikes and patrols
- Focus on raids, dungeons, PvP, and special events

**24-Hour Window**
- Data is limited to last 24 hours for performance
- Older activities are automatically removed from cache
- Designed for tracking recent clan activity trends
